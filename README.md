### Problem 

E-commerce applications give customers an added incentive to buy a product by providing additional suggestions in the form of reviews.

Obviously, reviews are useful and influential for customers who intend to purchase the products.


These massive amounts of reviews, however, cause issues for customers because they are unable to separate useful ones.

Regardless, the massive number of reviews creates a problem for customers because it becomes very difficult to filter informative reviews.

### Problem  from data science perspective

- To solve the problem of ranking reviews, I used a pairwise ranking approach that ranks reviews based on their relevance to the product and ranks irrelevant reviews down.

### Solution 


  1. Data preprocessing 

  2. Feature extraction

  3. Pairwise review ranking

  4. Classification.
